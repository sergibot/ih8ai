  Beneath the glimmering hood of AI <br> exists a nihilistic ideology: <br> humans are not good enough; <br> humans have nothing more to add; <br> humans exist to be controlled. <br> We are become robots: <br> cogs in the machine, <br> manipulated at will. <br> <br> Humans have minds, feel pain, <br> and have as brains the beautiful product of tens of millenia of evolution.<br><br> I was not born yesterday. <br><br>IH8AI.
